#Your-Music-World
It's a responsive landing page for a music discovery platform.

Achievements:
- Implemented semantic HTML structure (header,nav,main,section,article,footer)
- Used CSS Flexbox for layout and aligment
- Implemented absolute positioning for a badge element
- Added image assets and embedded Spotify iframes
- Included a basic JavaScript file and console log

Challenges:
Positioning the "#1 Hit" badge correctly on invidual track card

What I found difficult:
- Understanding the absolute positioning. Initially, the badge appeared at the top of the page instead of the card.
I learned that the parent container must use 'position: relative' for the badge to position correctly.
- Handling text overflow, which I resolved by adjusting content lenght and layout.
